# Exploring threads, mutexes, semaphores and race conditions in programming

## Terminology in multithreaded programming
#### Thread: A thread is an independent flow of control that operates within the same address space as other independent flows of controls within a process.
#### Semaphore: A semaphore is an integer variable, shared among multiple processes. The main aim of using a semaphore is process synchronization and access control for a common resource in a concurrent environment. 
#### Mutexes: In a multithreaded program, a mutex is a mechanism used to ensure that multiple concurrent threads do not try to execute a critical section of code simultaneously. 
#### Race Condition: By definition, a race condition is a condition of a program where its behavior depends on relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes.
